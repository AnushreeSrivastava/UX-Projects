# At your service
## An on demand services app

This project was the part of our Graduate student individual project for ITIS-6350 Rapid Prototyping course. This report mainly focuses on the research of new prototyping tool which was not covered through our course. This project is intended to make use of the new tool or techniques by making an interactive prototype and analyzing what can be achieved with this tool. What are the advantages and disadvantages using this tool over other tool discussed in the class.


Here I have researched and make my prototype on Adobe XD tool. The prototype which I made using this tool is of on-demand services app. Which helps users get services when need at their own home.


Furthermore, I will be discussing in detail about the tool Adobe XD and how it helped me to make my prototype. The functionality or aspects my prototype is covering, design patterns I incorporated into my prototype, Wizard of OZ study with four or more participants, content-fidelity matrix,etc.
